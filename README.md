iSonic is an implementation of the [Subsonic project API](http://www.subsonic.org/pages/api.jsp), but instead of having
its own music library like the original [Subsonic application](http://www.subsonic.org), it interacts directly with
your iTunes library. That way you can:

* Use all metadata from iTunes
* Update play counts and last played dates on iTunes
* Use iTunes interface for managing your music


__It is still a work in progress, and has no releases available__
